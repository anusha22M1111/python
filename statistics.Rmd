## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
install.packages("e1071")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(e1071)
```



```{r}
n=na.omit(faithful)
```
```{r}
```


```{r}
d=n$eruptions
mean(d)
median(d)
quantile(d,c(.58))
IQR(d)
var(d)
sd(d)
moment(d,order=3,center=TRUE)
skewness(d)
kurtosis(d)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
